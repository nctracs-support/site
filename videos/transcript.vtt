00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi and welcome to the electronic health records data support team website.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We are working collaboratively with the NC TraCS program to offer support to clinical researchers.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I'm excited to tell you about this program.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Our group provides timely and targeted support to clinical researchers who are using data provided by NC TraCS.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Our group engages with the entire data life cycle.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
However, we do focus on processing, management, analysis,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
visualization and interpretation, specifically. In providing this support,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
some of the focus that we have is on coding

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
help - R, Python, and some SAS.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We have limited assistance with data cleaning,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
data preparation, and data preprocessing.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We also offer consultations on statistical techniques and help with data visualization.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We look forward to working with you,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
please poke around our website and get in touch if you have any questions.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Thank you so much.
