00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to the NCTraCS tutorial series.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Today's topic is about confidence interval and prediction interval.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There are key concepts in statistical inference and estimation rather than in hypothesis testing specifically.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
These two concepts provide critical insights into the precision of estimates and predictions across various 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
statistical analysis.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
As a reminder, our motivation example is to investigate whether smoking reduces lung function.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Forced Vital Capacity was measured in 100 men, of whom 36 were smokers and 94 were non-smokers.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We have the statistics of these two groups, including mean, standard deviation, standard error, listed in 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the table. A confidence interval, in short CI, provides a range of values that is likely to contain the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
true population parameter based on the sample data.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It provides an interval estimate for a population parameter, such as the mean and proportion.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
An example is the main lung function of smokers.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The interpretation of the confidence interval is that, take a level of 5% as an example,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
a 95% confidence interval means that if we were to take many samples and calculate the CI for each 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
sample, about 95 percent of those intervals would contain the true population mean. For the smoking and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
lung function study,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
if we were to take many samples and calculate the CI for each sample,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
about 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean FVC of smokers.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Typically, for a sample mean,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
the confidence interval is calculated as, CI equals X bar plus minus Z times S divided 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
by the square root of N.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And here, X bar is the sample mean, and Z is the z-score for the desired 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
confidence interval, s is the sample standard deviation, and N is the sample size.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And now, let's move to the prediction interval.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
A prediction interval estimates the range within which an individual future observation is likely to 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
fall based on the sample data.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It provides an interval for an individual outcome, in the smokers and lung function example,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the prediction interval describes an interval for the FVC for a single smoker in the future.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The interpretation of a 95% prediction interval is that 95% of individual observations are expected to 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
fall within this range if sampled repeatedly. In the same smoking study,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
if we calculate a 95% prediction interval for FVC,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000
we may say that 95% of FVC for an individual smoker will fall within this interval if 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
sampled repeatedly. For a prediction interval,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
the calculation is similar but includes an additional variance to account for the uncertainty in predicting 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
an individual value.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Here, the prediction interval equals X bar plus minus Z times the square root of S squared times one over N 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
plus one, where the square root adjusts for both sample mean and individual observation variances.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Here, we compare the key differences between the confidence interval and prediction interval.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
First, confidence intervals estimate population parameters while the prediction intervals estimate individual future 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
values. And regarding the width of intervals,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
confidence intervals tend to be narrower than prediction intervals because they focus on estimating the mean,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
not individual outcomes.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
While the prediction intervals are wider than confidence intervals because they account for both the variability in estimating the 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
mean and the additional variability around individual data points.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
They also differ in interpretation context.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000
The confidence intervals are about parameter estimation in a population, while the prediction intervals relate to 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
individual predictions within that population.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
The primary area of intervals is used for parameter estimation in inferential statistics,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
while the prediction intervals are core to predictive analysis and forecasting.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
The figure on the right side is the plot of prediction interval and confidence interval using the data set 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
of the FVC example,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
which is the same data set we used in the previous tutorials.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000
The black dot here represents the mean of FVC, and the blue lines represent the 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
confidence interval, and the red lines represent the prediction interval

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
around the mean, we can see that the prediction interval is wider than the confidence interval to capture individual 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
variations. 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
The interpretation of these two intervals is, for the confidence interval,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
we say if we were to take many samples and calculate the confidence interval for each sample,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
about 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean FVC of smokers.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
This interval only reflects uncertainty around the mean FVC, not individual values.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
For the prediction interval,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000
we say 95% of FVC for an individual smoker will fall within this interval if sampled repeatedly.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
This interval reflects uncertainty around an individual measurement,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
not the group's average.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Thank you for your attention.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I will see you in the next video.
